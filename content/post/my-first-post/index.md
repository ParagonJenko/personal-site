Hey all!

This is my very first post on my new personal site!

This is built using the Stack Hugo Theme, hosted on AWS Amplify and will hopefully serve as a base for my brain ramblings!

If you'd like to follow my brain splurts I'll be attempting to post them here but you can also find me on Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram and whatever other social media I find my way into!

You can also find my current freelance work over at https://ideasquared.co.uk
