## Misinformation really bothers me.

And I used to think I was doing the world a service by telling people they were wrong. It wasn't like I was just chatting absolute crap! I'd only correct things that I knew were true, and I could back up with cold hard facts from some form of reputable, non-biased sources on the internet. Except that didn't really matter to these people - they just wanted to remain dumb, or so used to frustrate me.

I really should have realised it's a sign I was neurodivergent but just something about people being so publicly and clearly wrong frustrates me!

I remember back in 2020 we had something happen worldwide, I can't remember what it was it must have been minor! When we had this happen I remember hearing so many ridiculous rumours such as:

- The government were going to declare marshal law and force you into quarantine.
- That if you caught COVID-19, you were guaranteed to die a slow painful death.
- That the world was imploding.
- That it was a super-virus as a weapon to destroy the west.

All of it was, and still is a ridiculous and it spread like wildfire on social media! As part of a previous freelance project that was more aimed towards content creation I made a little ["THINK S.H.A.R.E"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHZzASEWyDg) which came from a government project. It's just how to spot dis/misinformation and I did quite enjoy the project.

As usual with the mini-projects I do it never really got any traction and my focus was pulled away because of real life, COVID-19, other work and also my degree - but I did and do feel very passionate about it.

### Why it's bothering me again, but in a healthy and less manic neurodivergent way.

Well I currently work in a tightly regulated industry (financial services) and there was a post that went viral claiming something widely untrue. Which did make me think back to when I'd feel such a burning desire to make the other person know they're wrong. It's a time I felt this feeling again and I was able to really understand younger me's desire to have people understand facts.
