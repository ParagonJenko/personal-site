# Why Hugo gave me the spark of engineering again.

- COVID ruined my education experience.
- Because of my ordinary degree, I couldn't get on a graduate scheme.
- I felt disheartened with computer science field.

- Pre-pandemic I was focused on web dev/design with PHP.
- Pandemic I moved more into content creation, but kept programming in C# and C++.
- Post-pandemic I needed to earn money so I moved into whatever job I could to earn a living.

- Tried to get back into engineering/programming with small projects
- Projects never took off, thanks ADHD.
- My career rocketed over the last year leaving little time for side projects.

- Want a way back in on techy projects, specifically web related.
- I tried Gatsby, I just never got onto into it.
- I found Hugo on a whim, intinced by Go as that's what is predominately used on the backend of work.
